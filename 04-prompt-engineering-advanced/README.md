## Creating Advanced Prompts:

Let's dive a bit deeper into the world of prompt engineering and explore techniques to craft powerful prompts that will help you get the most out of your AI interactions.

### Recap: What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art of guiding a large language model (LLM) towards generating the desired response by providing it with specific instructions and context. It's like giving your AI assistant a detailed map and compass to navigate the vast ocean of information and generate the most relevant and accurate output.

### Why is Prompt Engineering Important?

LLMs are powerful tools, but they can be unpredictable. Without proper guidance, they might generate irrelevant or inaccurate responses. Prompt engineering helps you bridge this gap by providing the LLM with the necessary information and instructions to understand your intent and generate the desired outcome.

### Techniques for Effective Prompt Engineering

Here are some key techniques you can use to craft effective prompts:

#### Zero-shot Prompting:

**Example:** Prompting an AI with "What are the environmental impacts of plastic use?" without providing any context or examples. The model uses its trained knowledge to answer the question directly.  
**Use case:** Useful for straightforward queries where the context is common knowledge or does not require specialized understanding.

#### Few-shot Prompting:

**Example:** Asking an AI to write a haiku about autumn by first showing it examples of haikus about summer, winter, and spring.  
**Use case:** Enhances the AI's ability to match the style and structure shown in the examples, which is particularly beneficial for creative or style-specific tasks.

#### Chain-of-Thought Prompting:

**Example:** "Explain how a bill becomes law in the United States by outlining each step in the process." The AI breaks down the query into steps, explaining each phase from drafting a bill to it becoming law.  
**Use case:** Helps in decomposing complex tasks into simpler, logical steps, making it easier for the AI to provide detailed and structured responses.

#### Generated Knowledge:

**Example:** "Write a detailed guide on how to care for a pet iguana, including diet, habitat, and common health issues." Here, additional facts about iguanas are provided within the prompt to enhance the quality of the AI's output.  
**Use case:** Useful when specific and accurate details are needed, enhancing the AI's responses with supplemented knowledge.

#### Least-to-most Prompting:

**Example:** "Describe the process of photosynthesis, starting from the absorption of light to the creation of glucose." The prompt guides the AI through the stages of increasing complexity.  
**Use case:** Ideal for educational purposes where information needs to be delivered in a graded manner from simple to complex.

#### Self-refine Prompting:

**Example:** Initial prompt: "Write a short story about a detective solving a mystery." After reviewing the output, a refined prompt might be: "Improve the story by adding more suspense and describing the detective's thought process."  
**Use case:** Helps in iteratively refining the content to meet specific standards or styles.

#### Maieutic Prompting:

**Example:** After the AI produces an answer, the follow-up might be: "Explain why you concluded that renewable energy is crucial for sustainable development." This prompts the AI to delve into the reasoning behind its previous answer.  
**Use case:** Enhances understanding of the AI's reasoning process and improves transparency, which is especially beneficial for educational and debugging purposes.


### Varying Your Output

LLMs are non-deterministic, meaning they can generate different outputs even for the same prompt. You can use temperature to control the level of randomness in the output. A temperature of 0 will generate the most deterministic output, while a temperature of 1 will generate the most varied output.

### Good Practices for Prompt Engineering

Here are some good practices to keep in mind when crafting prompts:

* **Specify context:** Provide the LLM with relevant information about the domain, topic, and desired outcome.
* **Limit the output:** Specify the desired length or number of items you want the LLM to generate.
* **Specify both what and how:** Clearly state what you want the LLM to do and how you want it to do it.
* **Use templates:** If you need to generate similar outputs repeatedly, consider using templates with variables that you can replace with specific values.
* **Spell correctly:** Ensure your prompts are free of spelling and grammatical errors.

### Assignment: Improve the Python API Code

Here's a simple Python API code using Flask:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
name = request.args.get('name', 'World')
return f'Hello, {name}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
app.run()
```

Use an AI assistant like Gemini or ChatGPT to improve this code using the "self-refine" technique. Remember to consider the good practices mentioned above.

### Solution: Improved Python API Code

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/v1/products')
def get_products():
"""
This function retrieves a list of products.
"""
products = [
{'id': 1, 'name': 'Mango', 'price': 50},
{'id': 2, 'name': 'Banana', 'price': 20},
{'id': 3, 'name': 'Apple', 'price': 30},
]
return jsonify(products)

@app.route('/api/v1/customers')
def get_customers():
"""
This function retrieves a list of customers.
"""
customers = [
{'id': 1, 'name': 'Ram', 'email': 'ram@example.com'},
{'id': 2, 'name': 'Sita', 'email': 'sita@example.com'},
{'id': 3, 'name': 'Krishna', 'email': 'krishna@example.com'},
]
return jsonify(customers)

if __name__ == '__main__':
app.run(debug=True)
```

This improved code includes:

* Clear function names and docstrings for better understanding.
* Specific routes for products and customers.
* A list of products and customers with relevant information.
* Use of `jsonify` to return JSON responses.
* The `debug=True` option for easier debugging.

Remember, this is just an example. You can further improve the code based on your specific requirements and use cases.

### Conclusion

Prompt engineering is a powerful tool that can help you unlock the full potential of LLMs. By applying the techniques and practices discussed in this guide, you can craft effective prompts that will generate the desired outcomes and enhance your AI interactions.
