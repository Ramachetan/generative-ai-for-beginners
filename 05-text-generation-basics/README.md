# Building Text Generation Applications with Gemini and OpenAI

Explore the exciting world of text generation applications through this series of Jupyter notebooks. This curriculum introduces core concepts like prompts, completions, and the practical use of models such as `gemini` from Google. You'll gain hands-on experience in creating applications that leverage natural language processing to generate text dynamically.

## Overview of Notebooks

### 1. Introduction to Text Generation (`01-authentication.ipynb`)

This notebook introduces you to the fundamental concepts needed to start building text generation apps:

This notebook guides you through the initial steps required to set up authentication for the Gemini API. It covers the following topics:

- **Creating an API Key**: Learn how to create an API key that is necessary to authenticate your requests.
- **Adding Your Key to Colab Secrets**: Securely add your API key to Colab Secrets for use in your projects.
- **Installing the Python SDK**: Instructions on how to install the Gemini Python SDK.
- **Configuring the SDK with Your API Key**: How to set up the SDK using your API key.

### 2. Building Your First Text Generation App (`02-getting-started.ipynb`)

This notebook introduces you to the basics of working with the Gemini API. It includes:

- **Setting Up Your API Key**: A quick recap of how to set up your API key.
- **Running Your First Prompt**: Learn how to run simple text prompts using the API.
- **Using Images in Your Prompt**: Explore how to enhance your prompts with images for a more interactive experience.


## Learning Goals

After completing these notebooks, you will be able to:

- Understand and explain the functionality of text generation apps.
- Create and configure a basic text generation app using the Gemini API.
- Manipulate key parameters like token counts and temperature to produce varied outputs.

## Project Ideas

- **Recipe Generator**: Enhance a recipe generator by tweaking temperature and prompts.
- **Study Buddy**: Develop an app that helps users learn Python through interactive coding exercises.
- **History Bot**: Create a bot that impersonates historical figures and answers questions about their lives and times.
